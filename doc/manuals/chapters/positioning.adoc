== Positioning Methods

So far, OsmoSMLC provides only TA-based positioning.

=== TA-Based Positioning

In TA-based positioning, the serving Cell Id and the Timing Advance (a.k.a.
Access Delay) are provided by the BSC. OsmoSMLC returns a GAD "ellipsoid point
with uncertainty circle" as location estimate. The ellipsoid point is the
latitude and longitude of the serving cell, and the uncertainty circle is the
maximum distance from that cell based on the Timing Advance information.
